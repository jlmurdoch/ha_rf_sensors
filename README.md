Introduction
============

This is a collection of custom Home Assistant HTTP Sensor Arduino sketches.

There are three examples:
- Efergy Engage home energy consumption (433.5MHz)
- Auriol Weather Station + DPS310 for complete climate metrics (433.73MHz)
- Mitsubishi Ecodan heating system (867.8MHz)

All use the HTTP integration in Home Assistant.

Tested on various ESP32 and RP2040 devices.

Would be easy to convert to MQTT or other HTTP receivers.
